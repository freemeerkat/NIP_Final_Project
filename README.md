This project was developed for the course "Neural Information Processing" by Prof. Pascal Nieters during the summer term 2025 at Osnabr√ºck University.

It includes the main.ipynb file, which contains the main code for the implementation of Random Feedback Alignment (RFA) and experiments with whitening.

It concludes with a comparison of model performance on whitened and not whitened data and a comparison of the respective gradient alignments (gradients of RFA are compared to true backprop gradients).
